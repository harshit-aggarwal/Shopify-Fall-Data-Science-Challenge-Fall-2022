# The data does not pass the eye test as the max order is an order of 2000 shoes.
# This is something that an average customer will not do. This might be an order from a retailer
# The total order amount is hence skewed, the max order amount is 704,000 again something that an average customer will not do
# We can see that the median for total items is 2 and for order amount is 284. These numbers make more sense and are in line with a general consumer.
# To further investigate we can see the order distribution by number of shoes ordered

# There are 17 orders containing an order of 2000 shoes per order
# This clearly is causing the issue of having an high average order value
# As this is something that an average consumer would not do, we can exclude those orders and see the change
# We can refine our list to leave out the high volume orders of 2000 shoes
refined_list <- data %>% filter(total_items < 9 )

# However out mean is still high as some shoes have very high selling price such as 154,350
# We should investigate if this is actually selling price or if there has been a error in data collection

# If all seems right, I think the best course of action would be to use the median as average order value as this metric is more reliable when there are outliers and influential observations
# The value of the median is 284.
